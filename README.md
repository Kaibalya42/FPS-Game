In this fast-paced FPS, players battle enemies before facing relentless zombie hordes. If not killed quickly, zombies attack, reducing the player's health meter. Survival depends on precise shooting, quick reflexes, and resource management. As the game progresses, stronger enemies and larger hordes increase the challenge, pushing players to limits.
